# Blockchain

## What is the value of blockchain?
Blockchain allows parties to co-create a permanent unchangable
(immutable) and transperant record of exchange and processing
without having to rely ona central authority.

Blockchain focuses more on the exchange of value and how
to make it instant and decentralized.decentralized. Blockchain
is about completely redefining how business processes are implemented
and how they are also designed.

## How does the blockchain work?
There are 4 fundamental concepts.
1. **A Consensus Protocol:** this is in charge of manading how
transactions are recorded and agreed between entities. This is
what allows people to move to decentralized systems and
away from central authorities that prove validitiy of transactions.

This is also in charge of solving the double spend problem that
plagues digital currencies. The double spend problem is when a
digital token/coin can be spent more than once because it could
have been duplicated. Consensus protocols are also capable of
preventing fraudelent transactions.

2. **A Ledger:** This is the public record of all transactions
stored across a distributed perr-to-peer network of servers.
When a transaction is verified, it is added to the ledger as a
'block'. *Hence how we got the name 'blockchain'*

3. **Rewards Or Incentives:** A blockchain solution has a reward
system that ensures that competing interests are aligned.

4. **Smart Contracts:** These are what allow applications to be
developed on the blockchain.They are secure because on a
blockchain there is no singple point of failure(P2P Network, so
the code exists on every node in the network). This means that
there is no one place that the code can bve manipulated without
all the others on the network noticing.


## The different types of blockchain

### Permission-less & Public
Permission-les ledgers have uniqie design goals. They mainly
need to operate in a completely open environment without any
points of centralised trust and in which potentially malicious actors
arre allowed to submit transactions but also allowed to participate
in transaction validations. This then requires the *'proof of work'*
in the *consensus protocol* layer and is known to be costly. It is
known to be computationally expensive and utilizes a significant
amount of electricity, does not scale well and requires a large
amount of participants to be able to generate the trust required to
ensure that the network operates effectively. These systems need
in-depth analytsis involving reward models, game theory and
behavioural economics.

*eg. Bitcoin uses a permission-less & public blockchain*

### Permission & Private
Permissioned ledgers are based on a set of trusted transaction
processors and validators who are the only parties allowed to take
part in the consensus mechanism. They are distributred in a precisely
controlled fashion and can be equally robust in rejecting
un-authroized transactions or changes. This makes corrupting the
ledger extremely difficult. More importantly, in comparison to
permission-less systems like bitcoin, they require substantailly less
computational capacity and energy to run.

Private distributed ledgers restrict the people who can submit
transactions and access blockchain data to an explicit whitelist of
identified participants. This is suitable for regulated environemnts.


### Permissioned & Public
No one really understands how this is actually valuable yet.
It's allowing only a certain set of people to become nodes and
create transactions and validate them. While any entity is free to read
the blockchain.

I personally see this being powerful in a government setting. Where
only certain nodes can do certain actions in government, but the public
has access to review the actions. This will be a great way to make all
information publicly accessible.
