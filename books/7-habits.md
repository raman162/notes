# The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

## Perception

The power of perception is important and should not be underestimated.
The way we percept things influences the way we interact with things.
Consider the way we percept people, we treat them the way we expect them
to behave. They begin to behave the way we expect them to behave. These
behaviours are going to reinforce our perceptions of them and make us continue
to treat them the way they are treated.

We need to be careful when reviewing our perceptions of the world and the populus.

## Principles

Principlees are the way of life, they are not values. They are the terrority of
all society. The main **principles** of life are:
* **Fairness** - Treat others the way you want to be treated
* **Integrity** - Strong moral principles, (overlaps with fairness and honesty)
* **Honesty** - Be honest with yourself and then with others
* **Human Dignity** - Having a sense of pride and respect for oneself
* **Service**- Making a meaningful contribution to society
* **Excellence** - Strive to be the best pereson you can be with all of the qualities
* **Potential** - Recognize that we have the potential to grow and improve ourselves
* **Growth** - The processing of releasing our potential and imporving ourselves

It should be noted that principles are not practices, they are not guidelines but
are territory and foundation, our values don't necessarily have to align with these
set of principles. The principles are essentially like a set of natural laws that
we can live by or be broken by. We have to choose how we percept them.

## Inside-Out Process

Private victories precvede public victories. This is true, to solve any problem is
to first accept that there is a problem within you or be aware of the fact that there
could be a problem within you and that you could be ignorant of the problem. If you
accept that fact then you are one step closer to figuring out what the real problem
is.

## Habits
Our character is a composite of our habits. Sow a thought, reap an action, sow an action,
reap a habit, sow a habit, reap a character, sow a carachter, reap a destiny. To me this
ties in with the 10,000 hours of training principle. If you put time into these things
then you can become the ultimate person at these things. Things I defintiely want to
accomplish in life are:

* An amazing software developer (especially in the application space)
* An amazing parent
* An amazing spouse
* An aamazing business owner
* A calm, peaceful and happy person

What are the actions I am doing now to esnure that I will develop a character that will
solve all of these issues.

What are bad habits that I want to get rid of?
* My Temper
* My dishonesty with trying to impress people
* My addiction to my phone
* My akwardness
* My random outbursts (links to temper, and akwardness)

Breaking bad habits requires a little more than willpower. The initial braking of 
habits takes teremendous effort.

A habit is the intersection of knowledge, skill and desire.

## Dependence, Independence, Interdependence

Dependence is the most immature that you can be, independece means that you can work
and get through life fine on your own. Interdependence is recognizing that you need
others for success. Life is naturally interdependent.

## P/PC Balance

The P in the P/PC balance stands for desired production results.
The PC in the P/PC balance stands for production capability. In order to acheive the
desired reuslts, you must have a balance of the two, if you put all your effort in
producing results, you will run out of production capacity and you will no longer be
able to produce any results. It is not sustainabile to live that way.

If we don't put any effort in improving our own capacity we are setting up ourselves to
be in a limited space.

Your end results should be the 'P', and the tools/people needed to get to those goals
are the 'PC'.
